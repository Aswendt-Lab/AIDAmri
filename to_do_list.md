# To Do (Dev)

## Diffusion
 [ ] Auto-check b-table for best permutation using either DSI Studio's automatic method or by comparing fiber coherence values
 [ ] Auto populate tracking parameters "min length" to twice the voxel size and "step size" to half voxel size
 [ ] Confirm that tracking options CLI and workflow works as intended
